Homework 3
===================

Install:

- test`pyenv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py` # runs webserver


Note:
---------

I am using `Openweathermap` insted of `AccuWeather`, beacuse their service was not able to provide me valid API key :/
